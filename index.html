    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am from Brazil and I have been in United States since December/2017. I have Accounting Bachelor's Degree and I worked as a Financial Analyst at a bank in Brazil for the last 6 years. The change of country brought many challenges for my life but also the opportunity to learn new things, such as a new language, culture and skills, and because of that I decided to take a class on programming. The possibility of creating something new is very exciting and I did not have that possibility in my previous work.</p>
