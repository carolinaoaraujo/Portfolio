          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p align="justify"> Born and grew up in Brazil and recently moved to United States.
       Experience as Financial Analyst after working for more then 6 years in a top-10 Brazilian bank.
       The change of country brought many challenges for my life but also the opportunity to learn new things, such as a new language, culture, skills, and because of that I decided to take a class on programming. The possibility of creating something new is very exciting and I did not have that possibility in my previous work.</p>
